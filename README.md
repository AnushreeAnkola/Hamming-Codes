# Hamming-Codes
The main objective is, detection of single bit error, burst error and to correct by using the suitable   Methodology (by hamming distance concept). The purpose of this project is to visualize unreliable  Transmission of data during the transmission from encoder to decoder. It involves block coding, finding  the hamming distance between to existing code words, redundancy, error  correction, parity check code.
